# Securing ASP.NET
## One acronym at a time

### Notes

- The database files in the App_Data folder have been included, but you'll need to have LocalDB installed to make them work.
- If you're running the code, chances are that both sites (Breaking.AspNet and Securing.AspNet) are running at different ports than on my machine. So check which port the Securing.AspNet site is running at, and then check in the Breaking.AspNet html files if you need to change the port there as well (both demo's should point to the Securing.AspNet site URL).
